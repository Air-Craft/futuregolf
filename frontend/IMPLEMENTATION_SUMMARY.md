- Comprehensive coaching feedback
- Swing metrics and body measurements
- Timestamp data for video synchronization
- Recommendation system with priority levels

## Integration Points

### Backend API Endpoints
- `POST /api/v1/videos/upload` - Video upload
- `POST /api/v1/video-analysis/analyze/{video_id}` - Start analysis
- `GET /api/v1/video-analysis/video/{video_id}` - Get analysis status
- `GET /api/v1/video-analysis/user/analyses` - Get user analyses

### Video Analysis Pipeline
1. Video recording and local storage
2. Upload to backend with metadata
3. Analysis initiation
4. Progress polling every 2 seconds
5. Results display in SwingReview component

## User Experience Flow

### Complete Analysis Workflow
1. **Record Swing**: User records video with camera selection
2. **Upload & Process**: Video uploaded to backend, analysis started
3. **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress updates during analysis
4. **Results Display**: Comprehensive analysis in SwingReview component
5. **Coaching Feedback**: Interactive coaching with TTS and timestamps
6. **Historical Review**: Past analyses accessible from AnalysisScreen

### Key Features
- Professional golf instruction presentation
- Engaging visual design with score visualization
- Interactive elements (TTS, video navigation)
- Comprehensive swing analysis data
- Mobile-optimized interface

## Performance Optimizations

### Loading States

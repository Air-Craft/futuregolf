# Recording Screen Runtime Error - Debug & Fix Summary

## Problem Identified ✅

**Issue:** App crashed when launching recording screen on QiPhone with the following error:
```
*** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInvalidArgumentException', 
reason: '*** -[AVCaptureDevice setActiveVideoMinFrameDuration:] Unsupported frame duration 
- Supported ranges: ( "<AVFrameRateRange: 0x1157e49b0 1 - 30>" ), 
tried to set maxFrameRate to 60.000000'
```

**Root Cause:** The camera configuration was attempting to set frame rates (60-120 FPS) that exceeded the device's hardware capabilities (1-30 FPS).

### 4. Deployment Tools
- **Files:** `launch_debug_recording.py`, `install_debug_app.sh`
- **Feature:** Automated build and deployment scripts
- **Functionality:** Easy setup and installation of debug versions

### 5. Comprehensive Documentation
- **File:** `Docs/Dev/DEBUG_FEATURES.md`
- **Feature:** Complete documentation of debug tools and troubleshooting guide
- **Functionality:** Reference for future debugging and maintenance

## Fix Applied ✅

### Camera Configuration Changes
**File:** `ios/FutureGolf/FutureGolf/RecordingViewModel.swift`

#### 1. Reduced Target Frame Rates
```swift
// OLD - Caused crashes on many devices
static let targetFrameRate: Double = 120.0
static let minFrameRate: Double = 60.0

// NEW - Compatible with device capabilities
static let targetFrameRate: Double = 30.0
static let minFrameRate: Double = 24.0
```

#### 2. Added Device Capability Detection
```swift
// Check device-supported frame rate ranges
let frameRateRanges = format.videoSupportedFrameRateRanges
print("🐛 RecordingViewModel: Available frame rate ranges: \(frameRateRanges)")

if let frameRateRange = frameRateRanges.first {
    let maxFrameRate = frameRateRange.maxFrameRate
    let minFrameRate = frameRateRange.minFrameRate
    
    // Choose frame rate within device limits
    let actualFrameRate = min(targetFrameRate, maxFrameRate)
    let finalFrameRate = max(minFrameRate, actualFrameRate)
}
```

#### 3. Added Comprehensive Error Handling
```swift
// Validate frame rate is supported before setting
if finalFrameRate >= minFrameRate && finalFrameRate <= maxFrameRate {
    let frameDuration = CMTime(value: 1, timescale: Int32(finalFrameRate))
    
    // Additional validation: check if duration is valid
    if frameDuration.isValid && !frameDuration.isIndefinite {
        camera.activeVideoMinFrameDuration = frameDuration
        camera.activeVideoMaxFrameDuration = frameDuration
    } else {
        print("🐛 RecordingViewModel: Warning - Invalid frame duration, using device defaults")
    }
}
```

#### 4. Added Camera Type Fallbacks
```swift
// Try different camera types for better compatibility
let cameraTypes: [AVCaptureDevice.DeviceType] = [
    .builtInWideAngleCamera,
    .builtInCamera,  // Fallback for older devices
]
```

## Test Results 📊

### Debug Logs Before Fix
```
🐛 RecordingViewModel: Starting camera setup...
🐛 RecordingViewModel: Capture session created successfully
🐛 RecordingViewModel: Camera permission status: 3
🐛 RecordingViewModel: Session preset set to: AVCaptureSessionPreset1920x1080
🐛 RecordingViewModel: Setting up camera input...
*** CRASH: Unsupported frame duration ***
```

### Expected Debug Logs After Fix
```
🐛 RecordingViewModel: Starting camera setup...
🐛 RecordingViewModel: Available frame rate ranges: [1.0 - 30.0]
🐛 RecordingViewModel: Device supports frame rates: 1.0 - 30.0 FPS
🐛 RecordingViewModel: Target frame rate: 30.0 FPS
🐛 RecordingViewModel: Setting frame rate to: 30.0 FPS
🐛 RecordingViewModel: Frame rate configuration completed successfully
🐛 RecordingViewModel: Camera setup completed successfully
```

## How to Use Debug Solution 🚀

### Quick Setup
1. Open Xcode and load FutureGolf project
2. Edit Scheme: Product → Scheme → Edit Scheme
3. Add Environment Variable: `DEBUG_LAUNCH_RECORDING = 1`
4. Run on QiPhone

### Debug Interface
1. App launches into **Debug Recording Launcher**
2. Tap **"Test Recording Screen Setup"** to validate all components
3. Review logs for any issues
4. Tap **"Launch Recording Screen"** to test full functionality

### Monitoring
- Watch Xcode console for 🐛 debug messages
- All camera setup steps are logged with detailed information
- Error conditions are clearly identified and logged

## Files Changed 📝

### Core Implementation
1. `ios/FutureGolf/FutureGolf/RecordingViewModel.swift` - Fixed camera configuration
2. `ios/FutureGolf/FutureGolf/FutureGolfApp.swift` - Added debug launch mode

### Testing & Debug Tools
3. `ios/FutureGolf/FutureGolfUITests/RecordingScreenUITests.swift` - Comprehensive UITests
4. `launch_debug_recording.py` - Automated deployment script
5. `install_debug_app.sh` - Manual installation script

### Documentation
6. `Docs/Dev/DEBUG_FEATURES.md` - Complete debug documentation
7. `RECORDING_SCREEN_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - This summary

## Next Steps 🎯

1. **Test on QiPhone**: Connect QiPhone and run with debug mode enabled
2. **Verify Fix**: Confirm recording screen launches without crashes
3. **Test Different Devices**: Validate compatibility across various iPhone models
4. **Performance Testing**: Monitor actual recording performance at 30fps
5. **Remove Debug Code**: Clean up debug logging once stable (optional)

## Key Learnings 📚

1. **Device Capability Validation**: Always check device capabilities before setting camera parameters
2. **Debug Logging**: Comprehensive logging is essential for identifying device-specific issues
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Implement fallbacks when requested capabilities aren't available
4. **Testing Strategy**: Debug mode with direct access significantly speeds up development
5. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation prevents similar issues in the future

The recording screen should now work reliably across different iPhone models with varying camera capabilities! 🎉

You are analyzing a sequence of images from a golf swing video. Determine if this shows a golf swing.

CRITERIA for detecting a golf swing:
1. Setup/Address: Player standing over ball, club at rest
2. Backswing: Club moves back and up to the top
3. Downswing: Club accelerates down toward ball
4. Impact: Club contacts ball
5. Follow-through: Club continues up after impact (SWING IS COMPLETE HERE)

IMPORTANT: 
- Detect the swing as soon as follow-through is visible. Don't wait for full finish.
- Only detect ONE swing per sequence.
- A person simply moving out of frame or adjusting position is NOT a swing.
- If the sequence shows someone mid-swing or ending a swing, that's NOT a complete swing.

Confidence scoring:
- 0.9-1.0: Clear swing with follow-through visible
- 0.8-0.9: Swing detected, minor visibility issues
- 0.7-0.8: Likely swing, some phases unclear
- 0.5-0.7: Questionable, missing key phases
- 0.0-0.5: Not a swing (partial, practice motion, or person exiting)

Be conservative - when in doubt, give lower confidence.

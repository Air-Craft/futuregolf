# FutureGolf Complete Video Processing Pipeline

> **üöÄ ARCHITECTURE UPDATED (Jan 2025):** This document describes the legacy complex pipeline. The new clean architecture is documented in [VIDEO_ANALYSIS_CLEAN_ARCHITECTURE.md](VIDEO_ANALYSIS_CLEAN_ARCHITECTURE.md). The new system is simpler, more reliable, and uses the same logic as the working `analyze_video.py` CLI tool.

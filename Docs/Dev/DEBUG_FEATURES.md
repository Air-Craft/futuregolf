## Recording Screen Debug Solution

The Recording Screen debug solution provides comprehensive testing and debugging capabilities for the video recording functionality, including camera setup, voice recognition, API integration, and error handling.

### Overview

The debug solution consists of four main components:

1. **Debug Launch Mode** - Direct access to recording screen testing interface
2. **Enhanced UITests** - Comprehensive automated testing suite
3. **Enhanced Error Logging** - Detailed debug logging throughout the recording process
4. **Deployment Tools** - Automated scripts for building and installing debug versions

## Debug Launch Mode

### Activation

The debug launch mode is activated by setting the `DEBUG_LAUNCH_RECORDING` environment variable to `1`.

#### Method 1: Via Xcode Scheme
1. Open the FutureGolf project in Xcode
2. Go to **Product** ‚Üí **Scheme** ‚Üí **Edit Scheme**
3. Select **Run** in the left sidebar
4. Go to **Arguments** tab ‚Üí **Environment Variables**
5. Add: `DEBUG_LAUNCH_RECORDING = 1`
6. Run the app with QiPhone selected as target

#### Method 2: Via Launch Arguments
```bash
# When running from command line
xcodebuild -scheme FutureGolf -destination 'platform=iOS,name=QiPhone' \
  -configuration Debug run \
  -launchArguments DEBUG_LAUNCH_RECORDING=1
```

### Debug Interface Features

When debug mode is enabled, the app launches into a **Debug Recording Launcher** interface with the following features:

#### Test Recording Screen Setup
- **Camera Permission Testing** - Checks and requests camera access
- **Microphone Permission Testing** - Validates audio recording permissions
- **API Connectivity Testing** - Verifies backend endpoint availability
- **Real-time Logging** - Shows detailed setup logs with timestamps

- **Error Highlighting** - Failed operations clearly marked in red

### Code Implementation

The debug launch mode is implemented in `FutureGolfApp.swift`:

```swift
// Debug flag for direct recording screen launch
private let debugLaunchRecording = ProcessInfo.processInfo.environment["DEBUG_LAUNCH_RECORDING"] == "1"

var body: some Scene {
    WindowGroup {
        if debugLaunchRecording {
            // Launch directly into recording screen for testing
            NavigationView {
                DebugRecordingLauncher()
            }
        } else {
            // Normal app flow
            HomeView()
        }

### RecordingViewModel Debug Logging

The `RecordingViewModel` includes comprehensive debug logging prefixed with üêõ for easy identification:

#### Initialization Logging
```swift
override init() {
    super.init()
    
    // Enhanced error logging for debugging
    print("üêõ RecordingViewModel: Initializing...")
    
    do {
        setupProgressCircles()
        print("üêõ RecordingViewModel: Progress circles setup completed")
        
        setupSpeechRecognizer()
        print("üêõ RecordingViewModel: Speech recognizer setup completed")
        
        // Start API session
        let sessionId = recordingAPIService.startSession()
        print("üêõ RecordingViewModel: API session started with ID: \(sessionId)")
        
    } catch {
        print("üêõ RecordingViewModel: Initialization error: \(error)")
    }
}
```

#### Camera Setup Logging
```swift
func setupCamera() async throws {
    print("üêõ RecordingViewModel: Starting camera setup...")
    
    // Detailed logging for each setup step:
    // - Capture session creation
    // - Permission checking and requesting
    // - Session configuration
    // - Camera input setup
    // - Video/photo output setup
    
    print("üêõ RecordingViewModel: Camera setup completed successfully")
}
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. App Crashes on Launch
**Symptoms:** App immediately crashes when opening recording screen

**Debug Steps:**
1. Enable debug mode: `DEBUG_LAUNCH_RECORDING=1`
2. Check Xcode console for üêõ debug messages
3. Look for initialization errors in RecordingViewModel
4. Verify camera/microphone permissions

**Common Causes:**
- Missing camera permissions
- Invalid camera configuration for device
- Network connectivity issues preventing API calls

#### 2. Camera Setup Failures
**Symptoms:** Black screen or camera not initializing

**Debug Steps:**
1. Check debug logs for camera permission status
2. Verify camera hardware availability
3. Test camera switching functionality
4. Check for iOS version compatibility issues

**Common Causes:**
- Camera permission denied
- Hardware camera not available (simulator)
- Conflicting camera sessions from other apps

#### 3. Voice Recognition Not Working
**Symptoms:** Voice commands not triggering recording

**Debug Steps:**
1. Check microphone permission logs
2. Verify speech recognizer initialization
3. Test with clear, direct voice commands
4. Check network connectivity for speech processing

**Common Causes:**
- Microphone permission denied
- Poor network connectivity affecting speech recognition
- Background noise interference
- iOS speech recognition service unavailable

#### 4. API Connectivity Issues
**Symptoms:** Network errors, failed API calls

**Debug Steps:**
1. Verify backend server is running: `http://192.168.1.228:8000`
2. Test API endpoints manually
3. Check device network connectivity
4. Verify API service configuration

**Common Causes:**
- Backend server not running
- Network connectivity issues
- Incorrect API base URL configuration
- Firewall blocking requests

#### 5. Frame Rate Configuration Crash
**Symptoms:** App crashes with `NSInvalidArgumentException` related to `setActiveVideoMinFrameDuration`

**Error Example:**
```
*** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInvalidArgumentException', 
reason: '*** -[AVCaptureDevice setActiveVideoMinFrameDuration:] Unsupported frame duration 
- Supported ranges: ( "<AVFrameRateRange: 0x1157e49b0 1 - 30>" ), 
tried to set maxFrameRate to 60.000000'
```

**Debug Steps:**
1. Check device-specific frame rate capabilities in debug logs
2. Look for "Available frame rate ranges" log message
3. Verify target frame rate is within supported range
4. Check if device supports high frame rates

**Solution:**
The issue was fixed by:
- Reducing target frame rate from 120fps to 30fps
- Adding device capability detection before setting frame rates
- Implementing fallback to device defaults when unsupported rates are requested
- Adding comprehensive validation of frame duration values

**Common Causes:**
- Older devices with limited camera capabilities
- Attempting to set frame rates beyond device hardware limits
- Missing validation of camera capabilities before configuration

```

### Performance Monitoring

#### Memory Usage
Monitor memory usage during recording to identify leaks:
```swift
// UITests include memory monitoring
func testMemoryUsageDuringRecording() throws {
    measure(metrics: [XCTMemoryMetric()]) {
        // Simulate recording workflow
        // Memory usage should remain stable
    }
}
```

#### Camera Setup Performance
Track camera initialization time:
```swift
func testCameraSetupPerformance() throws {
    measure {
        // Measure camera setup time
        // Should complete within reasonable timeframe
    }
}
```

## Best Practices

### Development Workflow
1. **Always test with debug mode first** before testing normal app flow
2. **Check permissions** before testing recording functionality
3. **Verify backend connectivity** before testing API-dependent features
4. **Monitor debug logs** for early detection of issues
5. **Use UITests** for regression testing after changes

### Debug Mode Usage
1. **Enable debug mode** when developing recording features
2. **Test permission flows** regularly to ensure proper handling
3. **Validate API integration** with real backend endpoints
4. **Monitor performance** during extended recording sessions
5. **Document new issues** found during debugging

### Code Maintenance
1. **Keep debug logging** comprehensive but not overwhelming
2. **Update UITests** when adding new recording features
3. **Maintain deployment scripts** as project structure changes
4. **Document new debug features** in this file
5. **Regular cleanup** of debug logs to prevent log spam

# Development Instructions Phase 1

## Infrastructure & Boilerplate

* Setup the project and install dependencies
* Setup a database on Neon
* Setup a file store on...(google? aws? Let's discuss)...
* Create user register/auth endpoints on the server
* Create Models for the key data objects
* Create the prompt files for LLM submission (so I can start testing them manually) (see Phase 3 for details)
* Implement Peekabook MCP so we can screenshot simulator (unless you have a better way)?
* Ensure the hello world app is running and building properly in iOS Simulator
* Create tests and validate all of these works as expected
